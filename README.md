hackentines-day
===============
A simple, geeky Valentine's Day card deployed with Heroku. This is a quick project I did for a friend as an exercise in deploying a (almost) static site and writing some simple JavaScript animation.

*hackentines-day* uses Rack and Sinatra for basic URL routing. Here's how to use it:

For a basic greeting:

>http://hackentines-day.herokuapp.com/

For a personalized greeting:

>http://hackentines-day.herokuapp.com/name

The name you enter will be inserted into the card greeting.
